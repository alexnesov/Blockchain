# Blockchain

![This package is currently under development.](https://img.shields.io/badge/under-development-orange.svg)


3 blockchain projects: 
<ul>
  <li>Python, JavaScript, React
  <li>JavaScript, Solidity, React
  <li>C++
</ul>

Interesting take from TradingView:

"Who will lead connectivity for Web 3.0? #NKN" </br>



"TLDR SUMMARY: For Web 3.0 (Decentralized Internet) there are 3 main components like today’s internet - Compute, Storage, and Network. Think BTC /ETH for compute, File Coin / Storj / Siacoin for storage, and NKN for Network. In my opinion NKN could be the Cisco of the future.

Use cases: </br>
<ul>
 <li> Better perf and lower latency due to decentralized structure (non-centralized servers).
 <li> Have the ability to rent out the bandwidth you aren’t using on your home or mobile plan.
 <li> More nodes than any other decentralized network, leading to 0% downtime.
 <li> Data is stored on endpoints increasing security.
</ul>
"
